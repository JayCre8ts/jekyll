<p>Structures_Graph is a package for creating and manipulating graph datastructures. A graph is a set of objects, called nodes, connected by arcs. When used as a datastructure, usually nodes contain data, and arcs represent relationships between nodes. When arcs have a direction, and can be travelled only one way, graphs are said to be directed. When arcs have no direction, and can always be travelled both ways, graphs are said to be non directed.</p>
